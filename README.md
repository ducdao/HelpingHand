# Helping Hand

Helping Hand is a platform built to connect two types of users: organizations providing volunteering opportunities and users looking for volunteering opportunities. Once a volunteering opportunity is complete, the organization will verify the completion of the opportunity and it will be recorded for the user, contributing to their achievements. The website provides a feature for the user to generate useful documents such us Volunteer History and Volunteer Data that can serve as a professional reference. 

Helping Hand was built at LA Hacks 2017.
